# Google-Shopping LLM Scraper

Fetch structured product data from Google Shopping with **one command**.  
The script leverages the crawl4ai library lets GPT‑4 generate a sidebar‑HTML schema, and exports clean JSON.

## Quick start
```bash
# create & activate a uv virtual‑env
uv venv .venv

# install runtime deps
uv add crawl4ai pydantic

# set your LLM key
export LLM_KEY=""
```

## Running
```bash
uv run llm_scraper.py            # prompts for query interactively
```

### First‑run caveat → manual tweak
On the first query the script asks gpt-4.1-nano to infer a JSON/CSS schema and saves it to **gshop_sidebar_schema.json**.  
Google’s markup drifts, so GPT may guess a wrong root selector. Open the file once and set
```json
"baseSelector": "div.zxYWDc.q9kVJb"
```
You might need to change the div tag to a new one. You can do this by clicking on a product card, inspect element and select the sideview container (shown in the video)

After this one‑time fix every run re‑uses the cached schema—no extra tokens.

Example (truncated):
```json
{
  "query": "top gaming headsets",
  "total_products": 28,
  "scraped_at": "2025-07-28T09:30:15Z",
  "search_url": "https://www.google.com/…",
  "products": [
    {
      "rank": 1,
      "name": "Logitech G ASTRO A50 X Gaming Headset",
      "price": "$339.98",
      "rating": "4.5",
      "reviews_count": "846 user reviews",

        },

        }
      ]
    }

```
